Extracting the archive we got the following:
```
ls
 Hue.zip  'my collection'   openme.zip 
```

`my collection` is a directory and `openme` is a password-locked archive 

The directory contains a lot of `png` files with flags of states and some pieces of QRCode, reconstructing it
![QRCode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbzteam/CTF/master/WhiteHatSummer2017/Hue/qrcode.jpg)
scanning it with zbar gave us the password for the archive

```
zbarimg qrcode.jpg 
QR-Code:=== Ea5y p4ssw0rd h4h4 ===
scanned 1 barcode symbols from 1 images in 0.15 seconds
```

extracting `openme.zip` with the password gave us the following:

```
[openme.zip] here.png password: 
  inflating: here.png                
  inflating: flag.txt
```

`flag.txt` is just a dummy and contains `It's not here ^^`

After some research on the png we found out is `DotCode`

Scanning it with a DotCode Reader gave us:
`flag: d0tc0d3_s0_c00l`
